When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

if I want a reliable backup
if I want to exchange with other people
if I work on several computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'd rather only have stable version on GitHub, therefore automatic pull is not necessary
Also it allows to work offline

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork --> clone a repository from another contributor in GitHub
clone --> clone a repository locally or from GitHub
branches --> way to develop new feature on a code without affecting the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

to avoid branching and awkward merge

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Without git or github, I will collaborate by exchanging files without version control.
Naming could replace the version control, but it will rapidly get confusing.
I would certainly be more flexible with people not aware of git but more prone to errors as well.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
